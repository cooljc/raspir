Raspberry Pi Infrared kernel module (not LIRC).

This project aims to create a kernel module to send and receive
Panasonic IR commands. The main purpose of the project is to 
investigate the development of kernel device drivers with the 
added bonus of providing a useful tool for stress testing products
during software QA stages.

I will be lending on some of the work done by the lirc project 
more specifically the lirc_rpi patches found at this site:
